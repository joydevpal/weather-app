This is a simple web app for showing weather information as per the city name throughout the world. You have to type your city name in the input box and click on the "Show Weather" button to show the weather info.

I have used a free [Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) here to get the weather data.

## Available Scripts

Run the following commands in your terminal.

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
